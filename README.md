# Pandora's Box

Thanks to Arya and [Vorspire](https://github.com/Vorspire) for their efforts for creating and maintaining such an indispensable 3rd party tool. 

Because of the time's inevitable effect on things, this tool got old too. I will try my best to further enhance it with new content updates, bug fixes and overall refactors. I have already done some little bug fixes as it was not working with a fresh install of Windows 10 64 bit + UO: TOL patch 7.0.79.6

# **Some of my plans are:**

- Rewrite UO Installation Path detection mechanism, and custom path specifying feature, for once and for all the components in the solution, not just for Pandora itself

- Map -> Follow feature doesn't work and hangs the tool, fix it
- Add SE/ML/HS/SA mobiles/items/gumps respectively (This will take a while)
- Add new locations, for all the new missing Expansions.
- Check and Verify with RunUO latest + ServUO, for possible new additions, command changes and possible new feature-list
- Learn about box server and it's features, look for possible bugs, refactors, room for enhancements.


Since I am working on my own UO Server project, I think i will be able to do most of the above as I already need to do so and have a place to test them.

I will try to maintain this project alone on a forked repo of mine for now, if anyone is interested we can work collaboratively on it too.

Thanks
